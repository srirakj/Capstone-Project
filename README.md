# Complaint-System
A GUI based simple complaint management system in Java

### Problem Statement

1. The problem is to build a complaint system which records the information regarding the complaints registered by a customer against the company.It enables the user to effectively communicate with the authorities in the form of a feedback system aimed at improving company policies and features. It also encourages the customers to voice their inconvenience against a product or a company policy, thus increasing the opportunities for the company to improve its efficiency. 

2. The complaint system will first display a log in screen to the user, indicating the user to enter his/ her ID and the password assigned to the user. The user can either be a customer or an employee. Judging by the ID used for the log in, the system decides whether it’s a customer or an employee who is trying to access the system. 

3. If a customer has logged in to the system, he/she is greeted to a window that includes options that pertain to the customer’s demands. The window contains three options: 
- Add a complaint: When this option is selected by the customer, a window opens which gives the customer a platform for writing and filing a complaint in the database. The complaint number, which is unique to each complaint is provided automatically. The customer has the option to select a department to which the complaint is to be addressed. The text box prompt is for the customer to write the complaint. By clicking Submit button, the complaint of the customer will be stored in the database. 
- Edit complaint: This option enables the customer to edit the complaint registered, meaning that the customer is able to change the complaint registered or delete the complaint registered. The window shows all the complaints filed by the customer against the company. A complaint is selected and edited by writing in the text box or it is deleted. 
- Show status: When this option is clicked, the customer is given full list of the complaints filed by the customer with all the relevant information and also a status column is displayed which indicates whether a solution for the complaint has yet been provided or not. 

4. If an employee has logged in to the system, he/ she is greeted by a window that includes options that are of the employee’s interest. This window has three options: 
- Add Solution: This option enables the employee to enter a solution of the complaints registered by the customers. Since only a certain number of departments are associated with an employee, the employee will only be able to see the complaints that are regarding his/her departments. The employee can select the complaint out of the list and provide the solution by typing in the textbox. 
- Update solution: An employee also has the option to update or rectify the already given solution regarding a registered complaint by clicking this option. Here the employee is provided with the list of solution provided by the employee along with their complaint number and complaint. The employee can change the solution but cannot delete the solution. That is, the employee must either replace the solution with another or let it remain the same. 
- Show my solution: This option allows the employee to see all the solutions they have provided in the database till now. 5.The last option, which is common to both the customer and the employee the option to log out of the system. The user, when logged out, can access the system anytime and the data pertaining to the user will not be removed from the database.
